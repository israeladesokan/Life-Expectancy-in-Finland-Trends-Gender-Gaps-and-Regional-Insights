**Author:** Isreal Adesokan
**Tools Used:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX  
**Data Source:** Statistics Finland (Tilastokeskus)

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard explores **life expectancy trends in Finland**, highlighting how longevity varies by **gender**, **region**, and **time**.  
It also includes **forecasts to 2070** and supporting analyses such as **top causes of death** and **seasonal death occurrence**.

The goal of this project is to understand what drives longevity in Finland and communicate those insights through clear, interactive visuals.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze historical life expectancy trends (1971–2024).  
- Identify **regional disparities** in life expectancy.  
- Examine **gender differences** and how the gap has evolved over time.  
- Forecast Finland’s average life expectancy to 2070.  
- Present supporting indicators such as **causes and timing of deaths**.
